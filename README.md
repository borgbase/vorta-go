- [x] Backup status (icon, menu)
- [ ] Bug: exclusions are lost

## Development

1. Follow the [official steps](https://github.com/therecipe/qt/wiki/Installation) to set up a Go project in **Module Mode**. E.g. for macOS

```
export GO111MODULE=on
go install -v -tags=no_env github.com/therecipe/qt/cmd/...
go mod vendor
git clone https://github.com/therecipe/env_darwin_amd64_513.git vendor/github.com/therecipe/env_darwin_amd64_513
```

2. Test app using `$ qtdeploy -debug -uic=false -quickcompiler test`
3. Package for deployment `$ qtdeploy -uic=false -quickcompiler build` or `make darwin`

Important folders:

- `/ui` has `.ui` files provided by Qt Designer
- `/qml` has icons and other assets


## Deployment

See the `Makefile` for different deployment options. Needs Docker installed. E.g.

- `$ make darwin`
- `$ make linux DISTRO=archlinux`

For Linux, Qt5 is linked dynamically to match your distro's look and feel. Install required Qt5 packages like this:

- Ubuntu/Debian: `$ apt install qt5-default libqt5qml5`
- Archlinux: `$ pacman -S qt5`
- Fedora: `$ yum install qt5-qtbase`

## Translations (work in progress)
- extract strings: `lupdate -extensions ui ui/*.ui -ts qml/i18n/ui_en.ts`
- merge .ts files: `lconvert -i primary.ts secondary.ts -o complete.ts` 
- compile .ts to .qm: `lrelease qml/i18n/ui_de.ts -qm qml/i18n/ui_de.qm`
